# uDocker

uDocker is a Python "package" to make running Docker containers in prescribed 
ways simpler to laypeople. Built with the intention of making it simpler to
launch and build containers for educational purposes.

For instance, it's used by [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity) and 
[SIGAI@UCF](https://github.com/ucfsigai) in their projects to teach material
to their students.

## How to use it

It's not all that documented, but should be commented well enough to find your
way around. If it gains popularity, then it'll be more of a concern to expand 
the "package," until then... :joy:
